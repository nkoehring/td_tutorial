A simple tower defence game
===========================

…and a tutorial on how it was created

Introduction
------------

The plan is to create a simple tower defence game in JavaScript. I first
thought about not even using a game engine but then eventually chose
[CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com/). It is small and simple but powerful.

I didn't use it before though, so we can learn together!

How to use this tutorial
------------------------

This tutorial is spread over multiple branches in the Git repository of the
game. To read it step by step, check out the branches or use Githubs branch
selector.

I chose this way because it is a typical way for developing bigger projects in
teams:
 * Branch from `master`
 * do your changes
 * create a pull request
 * merge back into `master`

Key aspects
-----------

The main emphasis of the tutorial is to show how a Tower Defence game can be
made, focussing on the game logic rather than beauty. In the end there will be
a very simple game with simple shapes as towers and enemies.

I'm always open for comments and ideas. The easiest way to reach me is to
[file an issue](https://github.com/nkoehring/td_tutorial/issues).
